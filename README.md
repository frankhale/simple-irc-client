## Status

Works but with limitations.

**Limitations (will be resolved soon)**:

- There are no instructions yet on how to build and run the code.
- Only supports one IRC channel.
- Currently you have to edit the source code to specify a nick and channel to join.
- No app icon (so the Electron default is being used)

**NOTE (Building Source Code)**

If you are familiar with Electron all the code in this repository would be in your /Resources/App folder (assuming the code is built).
